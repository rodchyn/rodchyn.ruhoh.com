### Symfony2 framework
Why I write number 2 in framework name? If you use first framework version then I can say "It's completely new framework". But best thing in this framework *as for me* it's philosophy and community.

> What could be more useful than an application developed by users for their own needs? This is the story of the genesis of Symfony â€“ born from the imagination of the web designers at Sensio, a web developer in its own right. Symfony was made available to everyone under an Open Source license. This benefits other developers, who also have the ability to improve it by adding their own modules. All this was done in an environment of Best Practices, standardization and interoperability of applications.

Starting from 2.1.* version Symfony will use Composer as standard dependency management and follow PSR-0 standard in autoloading. This all thing move framework on top of PHP frameworks.

### All is bundle
Symfony philosophy follow "all is bundle" mind. What it means: any piece of code can be `bundle`. Also it provide a lot of components that you can use without any external deps. Here is some bundles for example: 

- BrowserKit
- ClassLoader
- Config
- Console
- CssSelector
- DependencyInjection
- DomCrawler
- EventDispatcher
- Finder
- Form
- HttpFoundation
- HttpKernel
- Locale
- Process
- Routing
- Security
- Serializer
- Templating	 
- Translation
- Validator
- Yaml

### What about database?
What best enterprise ready DB library you know for PHP language? Of cource Doctrine! And you know Symfony2 and Doctrine2 it's like brothers. It's highly integrated with DBAL, ORM, mongoDb, MongoDB ODM (object document mapper), migrations and soon OXM (object XML mapper).

Doctrine also adds powerful class `annotations`. Inspired by enterprice Java style.

### Mailer
Default mailer in doctrine it's Swiftmailer. IMHO best PHP mailer for now. Ah mailer it's too simple look at [DependencyInjection](http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/dependency_injection/introduction.html) service container.

and more...
